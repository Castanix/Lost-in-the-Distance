# Lost-in-Space
My first game created for the 2021 js13k space themed competition. Built under 13kB using the Kontra.js library.

You are lost in space in an asteroid field with only enough fuel to travel a limited distance. 
Collect more fuel in order to travel farther. 
Can you make your way back or will you forever be lost?
(Game can be a bit challenging.)
